This repository contains a script for generating the files needed to
make SALT RSS slit masks using data from large photometric surveys.

The code makes use of the `zCluster <https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/zCluster>`_ package.
The ``pySlitMask.py`` script by Steve Crawford (and possibly updated
by others) is needed to turn the files generated by the script in
this repository into SALT slit mask files.

We describe the workflow to follow below.
